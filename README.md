Your job is to write a modern C++ program to input this data, organize it into a collection of objects and compute the top 5 crimes using modern C++ techniques.

The program starts by inputting the names of the input files (crimecodes first, then the crimes file).  Then the crime codes are 

output:  
only the first 3 and last 3 crime codes are output 
Likewise, the first 3 and last 3 crimes are output.  Finally, the top 5 crimes are output in descending order by #.
